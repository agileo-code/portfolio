#### Proof of concept for video conferencing with custom actions

This project is a proof of concept to see how a videoconference (Jitsi) can be integrated into an application that communicates to send and receive events.

This application allows to send to all the assistants to the meeting room, in real time, events that generate sounds, execute algorithms or even send notifications
operating system push.

To test these custom actions:

- Enter grow meeting
- Put a room name
- When you are inside you must give the necessary permissions to use the webcam and the sound system
- Finally, use the button in the top right corner to copy the room's url and send it to whoever you want, although you can only try it out anyway.
- Using the last three buttons on the right, the magician's hat, the music symbol and the megaphone, you can see the things that are happening in the application and those attending the meeting will see it in real time at the same time.

This application has great potential, as it allows you to integrate actions or behaviour that your company needs with a video conference. It is very useful in educational matters, customer service or for kyc.
